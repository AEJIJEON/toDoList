## ToDo List 

It is self-made toDo List using only vanilla js.
This is a website where you can write down what to do today and see if you've achieved it.
It was completed by designing and adding some functions to the toDo List created by taking the Nomad Coder lecture.



### functions
- It is possible to change the username after entering it.
- You can check whether you have done the to-do or not through the checkbox
- You can remove one of all toDos at once.
- It is possible to check whether you did toDos or not through the check box, and the facial expression of the background emoji changes in 4 steps depending on what percentage of the work to be done have you achieved.
- Even after reloading, the user name, check status of toDos, and the background emoji are maintained.
