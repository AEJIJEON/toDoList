This is a website where you can write down what to do today and see if you've achieved it and self-made toDo List using only vanilla js.  
It was completed by designing and adding some functions to the toDo List created by taking the Nomad Coder lecture.

### functions
- It is possible to change the username after entering it.
- You can check whether you have done the to-do or not through the checkbox
- You can remove one of all toDos at once.
- It is possible to check whether you did toDos or not through the check box, and the facial expression of the background emoji changes in 4 steps depending on what percentage of the work to be done have you achieved.
- Even after reloading, the user name, check status of toDos, and the background emoji are maintained.
